waveform data
    binary storage

    whistles
        frequency limts against time

        data generator class
            What is being stored in the files
                time, amplitude, channels, detector, binary blob
                start time, end time (along side time stamp)
                random float for amplitude
        
        Using getters and setters if i want to be able to have concrete things (such as the channel recorded, or the ship)

        blobs of data - random numbers - (could test just 0s later)
            100 bytes
            1 kilobytes
            10 kilobytes
        date field - for when the recording was made - timestamp



        method to create database field

data store abstract class

generate around 10000 - 100000 data rows
    store excatly how big the data file is

inserting in SQL
    parametised cursor
    insert statements

When getting the read/write times of different files from the different storage systems, write these to a separate database for easy viewing.

Are the waveform files stored in separate files for each period of time?

find out the time it takes to get the files for specific start and end times
    as an extension, get the ones recorded on different channels
        (would things that are recorded in different channels be stored in the same data row? I would assume not)
        So if the duration of the sound sample is longer than the actual length of each sample, then have to output files according to what channels they come from.
